# Introduction ðŸ‘‹ 
Hi, Iâ€™m @gitgldarch, an enterprise architect at the Province of Gelderland (www.gelderland.nl) (regional government in the Netherlands). In my professional life, I'm interested in 'digitization' of society, especially with respect to governments. Therefore I work on several (reference) architectures, together with my collegues.
On a personal level, I'm interested in sports (trailrunning, gravelbiking and shaolin kempo), reading and topics as 'privacy', 'fediverse', 'open source'

# Currently working on ðŸŒ±
I'm currently working on the proper setup of the pipeline Archi-Github, in order to develop new reference architecture. In particular concerning the EU Act 'Single Digital Gateway'
